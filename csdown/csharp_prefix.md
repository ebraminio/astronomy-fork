### Coordinate transforms

The following four orientation systems are supported.
Astronomy Engine can convert a vector from any of these orientations to any of the others.
It also allows converting from a vector to spherical (angular) coordinates and back,
within a given orientation. Note the 3-letter codes for each of the orientation systems;
these are used in function and type names.

- **EQJ = Equatorial J2000**: Uses the Earth's equator on January 1, 2000, at noon UTC.
- **EQD = Equator of-date**: Uses the Earth's equator on a given date and time, adjusted for precession and nutation.
- **ECL = Ecliptic**: Uses the mean plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The x-axis is referenced against the J2000 equinox.
- **HOR = Horizontal**: Uses the viewpoint of an observer at a specific location on the Earth at a given date and time.
